# GraphQL-Nancy
GraphQL with .net Core and NancyFx

This is not a fully working copy it shows how to wire up the ui with the back end to accept Mutations and Qeueries. You can call you own client and make your own types and resolvers. There are tests that test the service and if more clarification is needed please free to message me
